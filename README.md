## Introduction

Mirtrons, a vital category of non-canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) originating from exon-intron boundaries through splicing mechanisms, play crucial roles in cellular processes. However, existing databases lack the latest data and structural information, hindering understandings of mirtron formation and functions.

MirtronStructDB is an online database addressing these gaps by incorporating over 350 novel mirtrons. Significantly, it provides corresponding predicted RNA secondary structures, offering a deeper understanding of the functional roles and mechanisms of all mirtrons. This enhances previous repositories, offering a total of 4,209 mirtron records spanning 25 species from 46 publications. Our database contributes for unraveling patterns and functions in mirtrons across species and diverse structural features. MirtronStructDB allows users to freely browse, search, visualize, and download data via a user-friendly interface.

In this repo, we provide the source code of the implementation of mirtronStructDB based on the flask framework.

## Availability

[MirtronStructDB](http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/msdb/) is available through the online web application
